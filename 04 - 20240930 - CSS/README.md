# Class 4, 2024/09/30

## Intro (30min)

- A website you like (Nell, Khulan, Fran√ßois)

## Recap (15min)

- Why would one wants to add `CSS` in their `HTML` document?
- Name three places where you can add your CSS in your document. Where would it be, preferably?
- What is the "cascade"?
- *I want to write a `CSS` selector to target an `HTML` element so I can style it...*
  - Name a **general** way of selecting that element
  - Name a **more specific** way of selecting that element (using **one** HTML `attribute`)
  - Name a **very specific** way to selecting that element (using **one** HTML `attribute`)
- **True** or **false**...
  - When writing a `CSS` selector, you can combine different `class` under one selector.
  - When writing a `CSS` selector, you can combine diffrent `id` under one selector.
  - You can give multiple `id` values to one `HTML` element.
  - Each HTML element needs to have its individual selector in order to be *styled* by CSS.
  - **General** `CSS` selector are **more important** than **specific ones** (and their styling overwrite specific ones).
- **Name three** examples of CSS properties and **what** they visually do.

Bonus:

- What was the most **common** coding "issue" experienced during our last class (guess: it's not really a ~~coding~~ mistake)?
  
## Tutorial: extending on CSS selectors (15min)

Last class, we saw several ways of writing *CSS selectors* to style our HTML elements.

In short: The more the combination is specific, the more it has 'cascade points' and the more it has precedence over other CSS rules.

But how does the 'CSS algorithm' actually works?

- Inline CSS = `1`-`0`-`0`-`0`
- Id = `0`-`1`-`0`-`0` (added for each in a matching selector)
- Class, pseudo-class, attribute = `0`-`0`-`1`-`0` (added for each in a matching selector)
- Element, pseudo-element, `0`-`0`-`0`-`1` (added for each in a matching selector)

## Exercise 1, HTML/CSS selector based on specificity (30min)

You are assigned with a *specificity* value.

1. Define a CSS selector that matches with the assigned value.

| Specificity | Name |
| --------  | --------------------- |
| `0`-`0`-`0`-`1` | Lucile, Matilde |
| `0`-`0`-`0`-`3` | Sam, Jeungin |
| `0`-`0`-`1`-`1` | Nell, Timmy |
| `0`-`0`-`1`-`2` | Khulan, Fedja |
| `0`-`0`-`2`-`1` | Duru, Kaja |
| `0`-`0`-`2`-`3` | Yoonjin, Max |
| `0`-`0`-`4`-`2` | Yalizah, Alexandr |
| `0`-`1`-`0`-`1` | Femke, Olya |
| `0`-`1`-`2`-`3` | Maria, Isaac |
| `0`-`2`-`1`-`0` | Mani, Amy |
| `0`-`2`-`3`-`2` | Myrto, Andrei |

2. Exchange your CSS selector with someone. Now, write the HTML markup that corresponds to the selector you received.
3. To make sure that the selector targets the HTML element you wrote, give that selector some CSS properties/values (the `color` or `background-color` properties as examples).

## Tutorial: more CSS (1h)

- Let's make a basic page layout with a *header*, a *sidebar*, a *main content section*, and a *footer*.
- We will use: relative positioning, absolute/fixed/sticky positioning.
- We will add some visual differentiation across elements.

Let's start with the blank template that we made in the previous class (download on this page). You can [download it there](https://github.com/francois-gm/go-kabk-y1a/blob/main/04%20-%2020240930%20-%20CSS/my-project-template.zip)

(click on the three dots button `...` on the top right of your screen and then `download`,
  
- Layout properties: `display`, `position`, `float`, `float`.
- Size: `width`, `height`.
- The `display` property with the `flexbox` value.
- More styling properties (what would you like to see?)
