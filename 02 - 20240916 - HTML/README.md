## Exercices

### a) Revisions

Each student gets the previous *XML snapshot* of another student.

You will review their code, and perform revisions on their code:

- Verify that the syntax of HTML/XML is respected:
- - Tags open and close
- - Writing syntaxically makes sense (plural groups and inside individual items)
- - Formatting (attributes are formatted as attribute**="**value**"**, the way <tag><**/**tag> is formatted
- Make amendments to naming of tags if it can be made in a way that is clearer, *semantically*
- Restructure code if it makes sense to you
- All elements if it makes sense to you
- What piece of information might be relevant but is not present? 


### a) Revisions (20min)
