## Intro (30min)

- *A website you like* (Lucile, Sam, François)
- Round table, each present their *XML snapshots* exercice

## Presentation 1 (15min)

Install VS code + set up a document (and do’s and don’t)

- Download and install: https://code.visualstudio.com <br>
- Set `word wrap` option on by going to `view` -> `word wrap`.

Shortcut for HTML template:

- `Shift` + `1` and `Enter` to auto-populate HTML Doctype in HTML.

### Exercice 1, *revisions* (30min)

Each student gets the previous *XML snapshot* of another student.

#### a) Retranscribe the code in an html file

First, write the code in VS studio and save the file as `y1a-01-firstname.html` (see example file). Think about respecting indentation.

Then save a **second version** with the name `y1a-01-firstname-revisedby-yourfirstname.html`.

*So, if I would revise Lucile's code, it would be:*

- `y1a-01-lucile.html`.
- `y1a-01-lucile-revisedby-francois.html`.
  
#### b) Do a revision of the code
  
You will review their code, and perform revisions on their code:

##### Step 1:

- Verify that the syntax of HTML/XML is respected:
- - Tags **opened** and **closed**, `<tag></tag>` is formatted, with closing tag having a `/` (slash).
- - Formatting of attributes: `attribute="value"` with `="`, `value` and `"`.
- Make amendments to naming of tags if it can be made in a way that is clearer?
- Restructure code if it makes sense to you (does the grouping makes sense)?
- *What piece of information might be relevant but is not present?* **Add 2-3 elements or attributes** based on the pictures you think are worth being present.

##### Step 2:

- Add some CSS 'inline' styling properties to your document.
- Highlight your changes by wrapping them in `<span>` tags and adding a style="color:red;"` inline CSS attribute (replace the red by the color of your choice, but keep that color consistent).

Example of CSS properties to play with:
- Color: [CSS color property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_color.php), [CSS background-color property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-color.php) and [possible CSS color values](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.php)
- Text decoration, [on W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-decoration.php), and on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration)
- Text shadow, [on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow)
